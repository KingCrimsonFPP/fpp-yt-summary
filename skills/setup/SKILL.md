# Setup yt-summary Plugin

The user is setting up the yt-summary plugin, or one of its skills has failed
because a dependency is missing.

## Task

Install the plugin's Python dependencies:

1. Run `pip install -r {plugin_dir}/requirements.txt`, where `{plugin_dir}` is the
   plugin's installation directory. If that path isn't resolvable, fall back to
   `pip install youtube-transcript-api yt-dlp`.
2. Wait for the installation to finish.
3. Confirm success and tell the user the skills are ready: `summarize`,
   `transcript`, `ask`, `ingest`, `digest`, and `mass-ingest`.

## Notes

- **`youtube-transcript-api`** is the primary transcript source.
- **`yt-dlp`** is the fallback transcript source and how title/channel/date and
  channel listings are resolved. `ingest` and `mass-ingest` need it;
  `transcript`, `summarize`, and `ask` work without it as long as the API path
  succeeds.
- Optional: installing `curl_cffi` alongside `yt-dlp` enables
  `--impersonate`, which helps get past YouTube's throttling on the caption
  endpoint. The scripts detect it and use it if present. Verify with
  `yt-dlp --list-impersonate-targets`.
- **Behind a TLS-inspecting proxy** (corporate MITM, some AV suites): install with
  `pip install --cert <path-to-ca.pem> -r requirements.txt`.

  For fetching, the simplest complete fix is to append the proxy's root CA to the
  certifi bundle (`python -m certifi` prints the path) — all three of the plugin's
  network paths default to it. Per-path env vars (`SSL_CERT_FILE` /
  `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` for the API, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` for yt-dlp's caption
  download) work too; see the `ingest` skill for the full table.

  Never disable certificate verification to work around this.
